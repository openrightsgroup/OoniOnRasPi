## lepidopter - Create OONI powered Raspberry Pi images based on [spindle](http://asbradbury.org/projects/spindle/)

## Description
spindle is a set of scripts to aid building and working on a distribution 
image. I've been using this tool to generate Debian wheezy images for the 
Raspberry Pi, with the aim of producing reproducible, unbooted, clean setups 
that require no manual intervention. It works by producing a series of image 
files in QEMU's QED format (I exploit the format's support for backing files 
and copy on write).

It's not massively user friendly yet, but hopefully that should soon change 
(and of course, patches are welcome).


## Current scripts
* `setup_spindle_environment`: Sets up an schroot using wheezy and installs 
the pre-requisites needed for spindle (mainly QEMU, as it turns out I haven't 
used augeas). If you don't use this, please make sure you have at least QEMU 
1.0.1
* `wheezy-stage0`: Create and partition an SD card image, perform the initial 
debootstrap on the host and copy the files to the SD image.
* `wheezy-stage1`: Complete second stage of debootstrap under QEMU after first 
setting up a squashfs filesystem derived from Rob Landley's excellent 
Aboriginal Linux. Setup dropbear.
* `wheezy-stage2-lepidopter`: Add in Raspberry Pi 'firmware' and do misc config (e.g.  
fstab, network interfaces, hostname). The resulting image is bootable.
* `wheezy-stage3-lepidopter`: Install and configure a few useful packages (such as 
ifplugd, sudo).
* `wheezy-stage4-lepidopter`: Install ooni-probe and needed dependencirs.

## Getting started
The following describes how to start building SD card images using spindle.  
The process isn't massively user friendly for people with no experience at 
all, but if you're currently doing this by hand then hopefully you'll find it 
helpful. Note that executing the `downgrade_qemu` script is necessary on most 
Debian and Ubuntu versions right now.

    sudo ./setup_spindle_environment  my_spindle_chroot
    sudo modprobe nbd max_part=16
    schroot -c spindle
    sudo ./downgrade_qemu
    ./wheezy-stage0
    ./wheezy-stage1
    ./wheezy-stage2-lepidopter
    ./wheezy-stage3-lepidopter
    ./wheezy-stage4-lepidopter
    ./helper export_image_for_release out/stage4-lepidopter.qed lepidopter.img

Now you can write stage4-lepidopter.img to SD card or test the image under QEMU (see section Testing image with QEMU).

## Testing image with QEMU
.. ..

<!--- TODO: Create your own kernel how-to --->
Requires a kernel image, build your [own](http://www.cnx-software.com/2011/10/18/raspberry-pi-emulator-in-ubuntu-with-qemu/) or use cnxsoft's [zImage_3.1.9](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/45842273/zImage_3.1.9)

1) Run lepidopter image in QEMU and redirect SSH connections from host port 2222 to SSH port on the guest:
```
qemu-system-arm -M versatilepb -cpu arm1136-r2 -hda lepidopter.img -kernel zImage_3.1.9 \
-m 256 -append "root=/dev/sda2" -redir tcp:2222::22
```
2) You can now connect to lepidopter SSH (use password pi):
```
ssh -P 2222 pi@localhost
```
